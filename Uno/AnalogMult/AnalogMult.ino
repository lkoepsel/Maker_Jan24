/*
  Analog Once

  Reads an analog pin and saves the value to EEPROM.
  These values will stay in the EEPROM when the board is
  turned off and may be retrieved later by another sketch.

  If a value has not changed in the EEPROM, it is not overwritten
  which would reduce the life span of the EEPROM unnecessarily.
